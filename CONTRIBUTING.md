## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, **DO NOT**
open an issue. Please follow the [Security Policy] instead.

## Reporting Bugs or Unexpected Behavior

Before reporting a bug, please search for **open** GitHub [issues] to see if the
bug was already reported. Duplicate issues may be closed to keep things
organized.

If you find an **open** issue related to your bug, please provide additional
information there to help debug it further.

If no open issue exists, create a new issue with the [Bug Report] issue form.
Please fill out the issue form in its entirety, including as much detail as
possible. This will help us debug and fix issues quickly.

## Suggesting New Features or Improvements

> [!NOTE]
> Not all suggestions are guaranteed to be implemented.

Before suggesting a feature, please search for GitHub [issues] to see if the
feature was already suggested. Duplicate issues may be closed to keep things
organized.

If you find a related issue, whether open or closed, feel free to add your
thoughts to the discussion.

If no issue exists, create a new issue with the [Feature Request] issue form.
Please fill out the issue form in its entirety, including as much detail as
possible. This will help us understand and implement your suggestion.

You may create an issue draft to gather early feedback if your suggestion isn't
fully formed.

## Contributing Code

You are very welcome to contribute bug fixes and feature implementations to the
project's codebase!

Before contributing code, please search existing GitHub [issues] and
[pull requests] to avoid duplicating work or submitting changes that may not be
accepted due to prior discussion.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Not all code contributions are guaranteed to be merged.
>
> Code contributions may be rejected if they do not align with the project's
> design philosophy, are incomplete, or introduce unnecessary complexity or
> breaking changes.
>
> If you are interested in implementing larger changes, please discuss them in
> [GitHub Discussions] or the [Discord server] to avoid spending significant
> time on work that may not be accepted.

This project uses GitHub pull requests to handle code contributions.

To begin working on a contribution, [fork] the project's GitHub repository.
It is recommended to also create a new branch for your changes to keep an
organized workflow in case you make multiple contributions.

When working on code changes, please follow the codebase's existing code style.
Make sure to test your changes to avoid submitting broken functionality.

When your changes are ready, [create a pull request from your fork].

You may create a pull request draft to gather early feedback if your changes
